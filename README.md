This repository contains the source code for the implementation of _Multiply-And-Max/min_ (MAM) based fully connected (Dense) layers in Keras and Tensorflow. Code needs to be compiled as it is dependent on the version of Tensorflow in use. Detailed instructions for custom ops can be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/create_op.
